    "There is still a lot to learn about machine learning, and it is important to recognize that we have barely started to scrape the surface of it. There are many things we could do to refine our model that we didn't touch on in this module (don't worry, these will be covered throughout your curriculum), such as data transformation, elegant methods for automated feature selection, as well as unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these exercises, we ask you to only complete **ONE** of the exercise notebooks, either `Python` or `R`. We will be asking you to predict wine quality using both Decision Tree and Naïve Bayes. Your exercises will serve as a sort-of extended practice in which you are free to try and refine the model however you see fit, but we do ask you to use both Decision Tree and Naïve Bayes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The questions will guide you a bit, but if you want to experiment or you find, through data exploration, a model that is better, feel free to do so. If you go this route, leave comments in the code justifying why you did what you did."
