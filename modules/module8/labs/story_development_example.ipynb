In this module, we are going to outline the steps involved in telling an effective story with data. \n",

    "This notebook will serve as an example of story creation by following the steps outlined in the [The 101 Guide to Telling a Compelling Story with Data](https://www.maptive.com/101-guide-telling-compelling-story-data/). This example is, by no means, perfect and there is plenty of room for improvement, which is a vital component to telling stories with data, being open to criticism. This week we will be asking you to do your own steps toward creating your own data driven story and, much like this story, we are not looking for perfection, just an understanding of the techniques that we have learned up until this point.\n",

All of the stuff that is done we have learned through this course, and the text within Markdown cells will be emphasizing the steps involved in story creation.  However, if you have any  questions on the code in the notebook, please don’t hesitate to ask.\n"

Instead, there are a lot of factors that contribute to a successful film and accounting for these would make for a much more convincing story, things such as second and third actor, or writer.  This is where feature selection techniques come in handy and could make your analysis a lot more convincing, particularly when describing your results to more quantitatively savvy people.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other ways we could better this model. We could have made it probabilistic instead of saying that these actors and directors would guarantee us these profits. The question could become, what is the probability that this pair, given the actor’s history of film profits and the director’s, will bring in X amount of dollars. This would be a lot more convincing. We would then pursue those with the highest probability in bringing in X amount of profit.\n",

    "Finally, visualizations could always be improved. Interactive visualizations, which we didn’t cover in this course, would be a particularly good way to visualize this type of information.\n"
