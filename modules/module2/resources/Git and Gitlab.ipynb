    "A body of work, including its complete history of edits and revisions. Typically, you will have one repository dedicated to you for each course. This repository is your private work (available to only yourself and instructors).\n",

    "### Clone\n",
    "Clone a repository into a new directory.\n",
    "Each time you start a DSA course, a seed repository from the instructors will be used to populate your learning activities into a private repository. This private repository is then cloned into your JupyterHub space.\n",

    "Incorporates changes from a remote repository into the current branch.\n",
    "This is needed at the start of each module, as new modules will be made available on a weekly basis in your private repository. This command will then incorporate those modules into your JupyterHub environment.\n",

    "### Commit\n",

However, as your Git skills advance, you will able to test-run various different approaches on problems using Branches, then your selected best solution can be merged into the master branch for submission (Push).\n",

    "Branches is one of the most powerful aspects of Git. When branching you create an alternate version of files and continue to do work without corrupting the original versions of those files. Think of this as taking practice unlimited passes at an exercise files and then being able to return the original exercise files as if you never touched them. The default branch name in Git is master. Every time you commit, you create a point-in-time snapshot of the files.\n",
