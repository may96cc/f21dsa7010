So, since we are operating on the output of the first line, we are telling `R` to *`filter`* on *`df`*, and select those rows that have the value *`Linda`* in the *`Name`* column. But notice again the `%>%` operator at the end of this line. Again, we are taking the output from this line, or a data frame with only rows whose `Name` column is `Linda`, and feeding it into the next function, **`head(10)`**. This is the end of our pipeline, and will return the first 10 rows of this data frame of `Linda`s.\n",
