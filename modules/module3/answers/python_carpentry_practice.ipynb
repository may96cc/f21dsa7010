Now, the beauty of baseball data is that it has been regularly collected for decades, so there is a lot of it, and it is generally well organized, so much of our cleaning problems won't be to restructure the data. Instead, since there is so much of it, we often need to do data conversions in order to tackle our problems effectively. \n",
