    "# Data Carpentry with `R`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of a data scientist's career is spent on data carpentry (also known as *data cleaning* or *tidying*. Pick your flavor) because datasets often come to us in a less than desirable format. Fortunately, there are several packages in `R` that make cleaning up our data a lot easier by providing functions to correct common messy dataset issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin, there are a couple of things that we need to understand about our \"*tidy*\" dataset. Tidy datasets take on the following 3 properties drawn from Hadley Wickham's [*Tidy Data*](../resources/tidy-data.pdf) paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Variables are columns*\n",
    "2. *Observations are rows*\n",
    "3. *Values are cells*\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping these in mind, we can derive potential characteristics of messy data, such as values as column headers, variables as values, or multiple values per cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is going to cover the backbone of data carpentry with `R` using `R`'s `tidyr` and `dplyr` packages.\n",
