    "Data carpentry wears many hats. There is the concept of table structure, which we covered in the lab portion, and then there is getting your variables in proper data types that make analysis and manipulations simpler. This practice will focus on just that and, more specifically, with datetime variables because these are among the most difficult to work with.\n",

    "We are moving away from the dummy data that we used in the lab and using a dataset full of professional baseball players. Baseball data is abundant. It has been actively collected for over a century. This particular dataset has certain components that could be modified, in terms of table structure but, as mentioned above, we are going to be working with datetime object manipulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin by importing our packages and reading in the data. Many of the fuctions we will be using today are from the `lubridate` package, which makes working with datetime objects a lot simpler (a lot, a lot). Read more about it [here](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/)"
