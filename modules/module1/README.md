# **Module 1**: Introduction to Data Science

This first module aims at teaching you the basics of data science with both `Python` and `R`. It does so by familiarizing you with some popular data science libraries/packages, while allowing you to interact and play with the code.

## For Deployment
The following files and directories (and their contents) need to be deployed to Jupyter Hub for students. All other contents in the directory are **development only** and should **not** be deployed.

If we are deploying the module in sections based off of schedule, each file/directory has the "*Deployed By*" day assigned to it.

Path: `~/`
